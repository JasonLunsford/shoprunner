Greetings!

To setup the demonstration please run:

npm install

via a terminal in each of the three main directories (server, sweet_soul, fancy_pants).

Also, please make sure you have a recent version of node installed on your machine. Nodemon is also helpful but not required.

Once installation is complete please keep the terminals open and run:

npm start

FancyPants runs on port 5001
SweetSoul runs on port 5000

To reset the db, please execute this command in a separate tab or via curl:

Thank you.
